# Design Philosophy

## Principles

Following these principles have kept overall design sane and surprisingly extensible:
1. Implement Confidentiality; do NOT implement or enable user anonymity.
- account addresses must be public
- confidential amounts are private to all except the asset owner and accounts authorized by the owner
2. Keep separate paths for confidential and public assets. Do not mix usage nor logic.
- mixing handling of confidential and plaintext assets is inefficient in the best case and insecure in the worst case
3. Verify all changes to encrypted on-chain state by executing ZKP verification on-chain.
- updates to encrypted balances enforce ALL expectations including validity of new sender and receiver balanaces as well as conservation of total supply
- owners use their keys to generate ZKPs that are verified on-chain for all changes to encrypted balances stored on-chain

## Choice of ZK-ElGamal Backend

The ZK-ElGamal scheme was selected for its close alignment with the ERC-7984 Confidential Contracts standard and its proven use in Solana’s Confidential Token implementation.

Advantages
	•	Address transparency: Sender and receiver remain visible, satisfying regulatory and interoperability constraints while keeping transfer amounts confidential.
	•	Verifiable execution: Zero-knowledge proofs guarantee that encrypted transfers preserve balance correctness without revealing plaintext amounts.
	•	Account model compatibility: Works naturally with Substrate’s account-based state and existing asset registries, avoiding UTXO complexity.
	•	Extensibility: Better suited for composable systems, account abstraction, and future programmable privacy use cases compared to MimbleWimble-style designs.
	•	Proven production precedent: Mirrors Solana’s Confidential Token architecture, leveraging the same twisted ElGamal + Pedersen commitment combination for efficient on-chain verification.

Compared to MimbleWimble
	•	MimbleWimble hides sender and receiver information, making it unsuitable for general-purpose on-chain use or composable smart contract environments.
	•	MimbleWimble’s cut-through model favors off-chain transaction aggregation rather than real-time execution and event emission expected in ERC-compatible systems.
	•	ZK-ElGamal provides deterministic, verifiable encrypted transactions that integrate smoothly with runtime logic, governance, and cross-chain standards.
